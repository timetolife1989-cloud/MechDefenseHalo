# Auto-Merge Workflow Test

This file was created to test the automated PR merge workflow.

## Test Details

- **Date:** 2025-12-30
- **Purpose:** Validate auto-merge for Copilot-created PRs
- **Expected Behavior:** 
  - PR should be created by Copilot
  - Auto-merge workflow should detect Copilot as actor
  - Auto-merge should be enabled automatically
  - PR should merge when checks pass

## Workflow Validation

If you're reading this in the main branch, the auto-merge workflow is working! ✅

## Next Steps

Once validated, proceed with placeholder asset PRs:
1. Placeholder 3D models (colored primitives)
2. Placeholder textures (UNSC color palette)
3. Basic VFX particles (simple colored effects)
4. Royalty-free audio (stock sound pack)
